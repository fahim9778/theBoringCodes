# This script renames all the PDF files in the directory to the title of the PDF file
# The title is extracted from the metadata of the PDF file
# If the title metadata is empty then it extracts the title from the first page of the PDF file
# The title is extracted from the first line of the first page of the PDF file

# Special thanks to chatGPT, BingAi and GitHub Copilot for their immense help with this script
# And also to the StackOverflow community for their help with the regex

# [ATTENTION!]
# To run this script, you MUST NEED to install PyPDF2 using pip or pip3 by running the following command in the terminal
# pip install PyPDF2

# [ATTENTION!]
# To successfully run this script, KEEP THE PDF FILES IN THE SAME DIRECTORY AS THE SCRIPT
# The script will NOT WORK if the PDF files are in a different directory

# [NOTE!]
# if the program escapes the loop before renaming all the PDF files, then kindly run the script again
